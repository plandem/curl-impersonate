Wrapper around executing command to run impersonated curl. Suits for cases when you don't need super performance, and it's totally fine to run curl via commands.

P.S.: It doesn't have any binary for curl, but you can easily build/download it from https://github.com/lwthiker/curl-impersonate

P.P.S.: Presets in this go package are the same as in repository mentioned above.
